##### Note

* Saving of CSV to the database after file upload for this module was based on the module-magento-sample-data
* Currently tested and working on version 2.2 - 2.4.
* This should work fine as well on version 2.1.6+ as it looks like there's not much change on the review module that would affect the code for this importer module.
